## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Develop

### Prerequisites

Be sure to have the following properly installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ru/) `v16.19` ([gallium](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.19.0/))
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
yarn
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server, run the following command:

```sh
yarn start
```

This command will start a local development server and open a browser window at <http://localhost:3000/>. Most changes made during development will be reflected live without having to restart the server.

Please note that the search feature will not be available in development mode. To use the search feature, first run `yarn build` and then `yarn serve`.

### Build

To generate static content for production, run the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

This command will generate static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.
