# Kanban

At OKP4, we are using Kanban as our agile methodology because it offers a visual representation of our work progress, helps us in prioritizing tasks and allows us to continuously deliver new features, which leads to increased efficiency and faster time-to-market.

## Kanban fundamentals

‚ú≠ Pull-based system

‚ú≠ Visualizing the workflow

‚ú≠ Limiting Work in Progress

‚ú≠ Measuring and managing the flow

‚ú≠ Continuous learning and feedback
