**Commons**: the commons are material or immaterial resources, public or private, which we collectively decide should be accessible and/or managed "in common, in the service of the common good" (CÃ©cile Renouard 2012).

**Sharing**: The OKP4 SAS approach is based on sharing. OKP4 seeks to generate as much new knowledge as possible by maximizing the sharing of data and processing services in a secure, transparent, reliable and easy way.

**Decentralization**: All OKP4 solutions are decentralized, transparent and verifiable by the community. Through decentralization, trust is placed in the code and not in a trusted third party. To better understand, read our [manifesto on data sharing ecosystems](https://github.com/okp4/publications/blob/main/papers/White%20paper%20-%20Data%20Spaces%20-%20Decentralised%20digital%20commons.pdf).

The OKP4 project assumes its singularity and implements the agile methodology.
