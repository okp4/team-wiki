OKP4 SAS develops the OKP4 protocol. OKP4 is an open source and
decentralized computing protocol that simplifies and maximizes data sharing.

Our ambition is to create ecosystems for the fluid sharing of data and
services that interact according to common governance rules, guaranteeing
the trust and interest of stakeholders in contributing : Data Spaces. These
Data Spaces are the crucible of new value chains in the knowledge economy.

The decentralized computer protocol OKP4 allows the custom creation of these
Data Spaces, and to optimize their functioning by automating the application
of the governance rules established by the stakeholders. In short, the
protocol offers the possibility of orchestrating the execution of databases
and services without a trusted third party.

Autonomous, open and decentralized, it automatically governs the valuation
of data through a wide variety of services, the management of consents, the
calculation of contributions to the production of knowledge and the optimal
remuneration of actors according to the value generated in common within an
economy enabled by the protocol token.
