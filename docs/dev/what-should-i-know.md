# What should I know?

## About code - Quality: our highest priority üíª

### 1. Consider code as a common good

The code we develop is a common good, it belongs to everyone and is the result of the knowledge and expertise of many different developers. It is important to preserve it and make it better every day.

### 2. Write readable code

Some figures and numbers: developers spend about 25% writing code, but 75% reading it.

Writing readable code saves a lot of time.

### 3. Avoid comments

Sure. Despite what is commonly thought, comments are bad practice. But know when to ignore this rule.

### 4. Quality over Quantity

No "Quick and Dirty" implementations but adopt "Clean and Solid" implementations instead.

### 5. Rely on CI/CD

"Never send a human to do a machine's job." ~Agent Smith (The Matrix).
CI/CD is here to serve you.

## About you - Ubuntu and Egoless philosophy üßë‚Äçüíª

### 1. You are not your code

Fight the natural tendency to treat your programs as part of yourself, and instead view criticism dispassionately on its merits.
A must read: [Egoless programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/) - a style of computer programming in which personal factors are minimized so that quality may be improved.

### 2. You shouldn't blame your teammates

Because the code is a common good, one person's failure means everyone's failure.

### 3. You should connect with people

Working with other people can help you broaden your horizons and improve your skills.

### 4. You should teach others what you know, what you learned

Sharing knowledge is key. And teaching others is a great way of improving your own skills and your own knowledge: "To teach is to learn twice." (Joseph Joubert).
